                <h2>Queen Of Jhansi</h2>
                <p>Rani Lakshmibai was born as Manikarnika Tambe on November 19, 1828, in a Marathi Karhade Brahmin
                    family to Moropant Tambe (Father) and Bhagirathi Sapre (Mother). Lakshmibai's mother died when she
                    was four years old. Her father worked for Peshwa Baji Rao II of Bithoor district. Rani Lakshmibai
                    was educated at home and could read and write. She was also trained for shooting, horsemanship,
                    fencing and mallakhamba. She has three horse-- Sarangi, Pavan and Badal.n May 1852, Manikarnika was
                    married to Gangadhar Rao Newalkar (Maharaja of Jhansi) and was later names as Lakshmibai as per the
                    traditions. In 1851, Lakshmibai gave birth to her son Damodar Rao who died after 4 months. The
                    couple later adopted Gangadhar Rao's cousin, who was renamed, Damodar Rao. The procedure of adaption
                    was carried out in the presence of a British officer. A letter was handed to the officer from the
                    Maharaja with the instructions that the adopted child should be given due respect and Jhansi should
                    be given to Lakshmibai for her entire lifetime.However, in November 1853, after the death of
                    Maharaja, British East India Company, applied Doctrine of Lapse, under the Governor-General Lord
                    Dalhousie. Under this policy, Damodar Rao's claim to the throne was rejected as he was adopted son
                    of Maharaja and Rani. In March 1854, Lakshmibai was given Rs. 60,000 as annual pension and was asked
                    to leave the palace. </p>
